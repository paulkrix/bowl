You are an experienced software engineer and 3d modelling enigneer.

Your job is to create a python program that will take a seriers of contour lines and turn them into a 3d printable file shaped like a bowl. You will use python and cadquery as well as any other necessary libraries. The program should first create a profile polyline, that, when revolved around the z-axis would define the 3d solid shape of the bowl. It will then take a series of in put 2d concentric wavy polyline shapes tha are roughly circluar called "contours" and use their shape to create a series of overlapping stepped shapes that form aethetically pleasing patterns on the base side of the bowl. Below is how the basic algorithm of the stepped patterns should work:

Algorithm:
* Map the contour lines to equal distances along the profile line, leaving room for the "foot" ring of the bowl in the center. The contour lines may need to be scales to allow for this space in the middle. The exact details of this mapping will be up to you to work out.
* Start with the outer-most contour line and iterate inwards.
* For each contour line, create a surface that is equivalent to taking the same 3d shape defined by the profile line and cutting it to only the area within the contour line is left, then scaling and offseting this shape so that it forms a thin extra layer on the bottom of the bowl. Image taking a piece of rubber, cutting it out in the shape of the contour line, then wrapping it around the bowl.
* Do this again with the next contour line, but this layer will sit below/outside the previous layer.

The contour lines are defined in the contours_fewer.svg file. These lines are svg paths with d strings.
The bowl should be very shallow - around 24mm high and 120mm wide.

Output should be STL
The bowl mush be hollow and uniform with a smooth interior - no patterns.
The foor ring should be 40mm in diameter, 4mm wide and 5mm deep.
The contour steps / layers should be 1mm thick each.
Don't reuse and of the other python scripts in this directory.
Don't change the shape of the contour lines except to "wrap" them around the bowl shape. Their wavyness must be maintained.


Before you do anything, please describe what you think I am asking you to do as well as ask me any questions that you need to know before you can begin.
